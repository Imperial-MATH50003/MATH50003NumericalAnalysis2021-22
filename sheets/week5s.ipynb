Define the entries of $K$ by $K_{ij} = ⟨e_i, e_j⟩$ where $e_j$ is the $j$-th standard basis vector. Note that by linearity of the inner product any inner product on $ℝ^n$ can be written as $⟨𝐱, 𝐲⟩ = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\sum_{l=0}^n x_k y_l ⟨e_k, e_l⟩$ by linearity.

The positive entries on the diagonal follow directly because this is the case for the Cholesky decomposition factors of the original matrix.
