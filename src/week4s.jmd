# MATH50003 Numerical Analysis: Problem Sheet 4

This problem sheet explores least squares, the QR decomposition including for
tridiagonal matrices,
and the PLU decompositions.

Questions marked with a ⋆ are meant to be completed without using a computer.

```julia
using LinearAlgebra, Plots
```



## 1. Least squares and QR decompositions

**Problem 1.1** Find and plot the best least squares fit of ${1 \over 5x^2 + 1}$ by degree $n$
polynomials for $n = 0,\ldots,10$ at 1000 evenly spaced points between $0$ and $1$.

**SOLUTION**
```julia
x = range(0, 1; length=1000)
pl = plot()
f = 1 ./ (5x.^2 .+ 1)
for n = 0:10
    A = x .^ (0:n)'
    c = A \ f
    plot!(x, A*c)
end
pl
```

**Problem 1.2⋆** Show that every matrix has a QR decomposition such that the diagonal of $R$ is non-negative.
Make sure to include the case of more columns than rows.

**SOLUTION**

∎

**Problem 1.3⋆** Show that the QR decomposition of a square invertible matrix is unique, 
provided that the diagonal of $R$ is positive.


**SOLUTION**

Assume there is a second decomposition also with positive diagonal
$$
A = QR = Q̃ R̃
$$
Then we know 
$$
Q^⊤ Q̃ = R R̃^{-1}
$$
Note $Q^⊤ Q̃$ is orthogonal, and $R R̃^{-1}$ has positive eigenvalues (the diagonal), hence all $m$ eigenvalues of
$Q^⊤ Q̃$ are 1. This means that $Q^⊤ Q̃ = I$ and hence $Q̃ = Q$, which then implies $R̃ = R$.

∎

## 2. Gram–Schmidt

**Problem 2.1⋆** The modified Gram–Schmidt algorithm is a slight variation of Gram–Schmidt where
instead of computing
$$
𝐯_j := 𝐚_j - \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \underbrace{𝐪_k^\top 𝐚_j}_{r_{kj}} 𝐪_k
$$
we compute it step-by-step:
$$
\begin{align*}
𝐯_j^1 &:= 𝐚_j \\
𝐯_j^{k+1} &:= 𝐯_j^k - 𝐪_k^\top 𝐯_j^k 𝐪_k
\end{align*}
$$
Show that $𝐯_j^j = 𝐯_j$. 

**Problem 2.2** Complete the following
function implementing the modified Gram–Schmidt algorithm:
```julia
function modifiedgramschmidt(A)
    m,n = size(A)
    m ≥ n || error("Not supported")
    R = zeros(n,n)
    Q = zeros(m,n)
    for j = 1:n
        # TODO: Implement the Modified Gram–Schmidt algorthm
    end
    Q,R
end
```

**Problem 2.3** Compare the orthogonality of `Q` between `gramschmidt` and `modifiedgramschmidt`
when applied to a `300 × 300` random matrix.

## 3. Householder reflections


**Problem 3.1**
Complete the definition of `Reflections` which supports a sequence of reflections,
that is, 
$$
Q = Q_{𝐯_1} \cdots Q_{𝐯_n}
$$
where the vectors are stored as a matrix `V` whose $j$-th column is $𝐯_j$, and
$$
Q_{𝐯_j} = I - 2 𝐯_j 𝐯_j^\top.
$$

```julia
struct Reflections{T} <: AbstractMatrix{T}
    V::Matrix{T}
end

import Base: *, size, getindex

size(Q::Reflections) = (size(Q.v,1), size(Q.v,1))


function *(Q::Reflections, x::AbstractVector)
    # TODO: Apply Q in O(mn) operations
end

function getindex(Q::Reflections, k::Int, j::Int)
    # TODO: Return Q[k,j] in O(mn) operations (hint: use *)
end
```

**Problem 3.2** Complete the following function that implements
 Householder QR using only $O(mn^2)$ operations:
```julia
function householderqr(A)
    m,n = size(A)
    R = copy(A)
    Q = Reflections(Matrix(1.0I, m, n))
    for j = 1:n
        # TODO: populate Q and R using O(m*(n-j)) operations
    end
    Q,R
end
```

## 4. Banded QR with Given's rotations

**Problem 4.1⋆**  Describe an algorithm for computing the QR decomposition
of a tridiagonal matrix using rotations instead of reflections to upper-triangularise
column-by-column.

**Problem 4.2** Implement `Rotations` which represents an orthogonal matrix `Q` that is a product
 of rotations of angle `θ[k]`, each acting on the entries `k:k+1`.
```julia
struct Rotations{T} <: AbstractMatrix{T}
    θ::Vector{T}
end

import Base: *, size, getindex

size(Q::Rotations) = (length(Q.θ)+1, length(Q.θ)+1)


function *(Q::Rotations, x::AbstractVector)
    # TODO: Apply Q in O(n) operations
end

function getindex(Q::Rotations, k::Int, j::Int)
    # TODO: Return Q[k,j] in O(n) operations (hint: use *)
end
```

**Problem 4.3** Combine `Rotations` and `UpperTridiagonal` from last problem sheet
to implement a banded QR decomposition that only takes $O(n)$ operations:
```julia
function bandedqr(A::Tridiagonal)
    n = size(A,1)
    Q = Rotations(zeros(n-1)) # Assume Float64
    R = UpperTridiagonal(zeros(n), zeros(n-1), zeros(n-2))
    for j = 1:n-1
        # TODO: populate Q and R
    end
    Q,R
end
```

**Problem 4.4⋆** Could one redesign the above to only use IEEE operatations (addition, multiplication, square-roots, 
avoiding calls `atan`, `cos`, and `sin`)?
Would it have been possible to implement this algorithm using reflections?
If so, what would be the structure of a matrix whose columns are the vectors of reflections?

## 5. PLU decomposition

**Problem 5.1⋆** Compute the PLU decompositions for the following matrices:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 2 & 1 \\
2 & 6 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 4
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\
2 & 4 & -2 & 1 \\
-3 & -5 & 6 & 1 \\
-1 & 2 & 8 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
