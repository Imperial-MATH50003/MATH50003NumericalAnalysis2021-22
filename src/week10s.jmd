## 1. Orthogonal Polynomial Roots

**Problem 1.1 (B)** Give an explicit diagonalisation of
$$
X_n = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\ 
                1/2 & 0 & ‚ã± 
                \end{bmatrix}
$$


**Problem** Consider heat on a Graph
$$
ùêÆ_t = Œî ùêÆ
$$
Use $U_n(x)$ and its roots to diagonalise the problem and hence deduce an explicit formula.


## 2. Interpolatory quadrature


**Problem 2.1** Compute the interpolatory quadrature rule for
$w(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$ with the points $[-1,1/2,1]$.


**Problem 2.2** Compute the 2-point 
interpolatory quadrature rule for the weights $\sqrt{1-x^2}$, $1$, 
and $1-x$ on $[-1,1]$.



## 3. Gaussian quadrature


**Problem 3.1 (C)** Compute the 2-point and 3-point Gaussian quadrature rules associated with $w(x) = 1$ on $[-1,1]$. 
Hint: $P_3(x)$ is cubic
but can be reduced to a quadratic.

**Problem** Show for $w(x) = 1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ that the Gaussian quadrature rule is
$$
{\pi \over n} \sum_{j=1}^n f(x_j)
$$
where $x_j = (j-1/2)œÄ/n$. 

**Problem** Solve Problem 1.2 from PS8 using **Lemma (discrete orthogonality)** with
$w(x) = 1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ on $[-1,1]$.
